Open terminal and type: hive

-- Create a table
 CREATE TABLE employee (id INT, name STRING, age INT, department STRING);

-- Insert some sample data
 INSERT INTO employee VALUES (1, 'John', 30, 'HR');
 INSERT INTO employee VALUES (2, 'Alice', 25, 'Finance');
 INSERT INTO employee VALUES (3, 'Bob', 35, 'HR');

-- Sort by age
 SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY age;-- Group employees by department
 SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
 FROM employee
 GROUPBY department;

-- Create another table for department details
 CREATE TABLE department (dept_id INT, dept_name STRING);

-- Insert some data
 INSERT INTO department VALUES (1, 'HR');
 INSERT INTO department VALUES (2, 'Finance');

-- Join employee and department tables
 SELECT e.id, e.name, d.dept_name
 FROM employee e
 JOIN department d
 ONe.department = d.dept_name;

-- Select specific columns (Projection)
 SELECT id, name FROM employee;

CREATE TABLE employee (
eid INT,
name STRING,
role STRING,
salary FLOAT
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ;

2)Insert DATA:
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/path/to/employee_data.txt' INTO TABLE employee;

2.5)DESCRIBE DATA:
describe employee;

3)Select Records:

4)Filtering:
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE role = 'SDE';

5)Grouping:
SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM employee GROUP BY role;

6)Sorting:
SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC;

7)Join Query:
SELECT e.name, e.role, p.city
FROM employee e
JOIN personal p ON e.eid = p.id;

8)Specific column Extraction:
