Pig Queries:

Save the commands in a .pig file , say sample_script.pig

In the terminal type command:
pig - x local sample_script.pig

-- Load the data
 EMPLOYEE=LOAD'employee.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (id:int, name:chararray, age:int,
 department:chararray);

-- Sort by age
 SORTED_EMPLOYEE=ORDER EMPLOYEE BY age;
 DUMPSORTED_EMPLOYEE;

-- Group by department
 GROUPED_EMPLOYEE=GROUP EMPLOYEE BY department;
 DUMPGROUPED_EMPLOYEE;

-- Assuming another dataset for departments
 DEPARTMENT=LOAD'department.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (dept_id:int,
 dept_name:chararray)

-- Join the employee and department
 JOINED_DATA = JOIN EMPLOYEE BY department, DEPARTMENT BY dept_name;
 DUMPJOINED_DATA;

-- Project name and age
 PROJECTED_DATA =FOREACH EMPLOYEE GENERATE name,age;
 DUMPPROJECTED_DATA;

-- Filter employees older than 30
 FILTERED_EMPLOYEE =FILTER EMPLOYEE BY age>30;
 DUMPFILTERED_EMPLOYEE;


Example 2:

Save the commands in a .pig file , say sample_script.pig

In the terminal command:
pig - x local sample_script.pig

Sample datasets:

employee.csv:
eid,name,role,salary
1,John Doe,Software Developer,75000
2,Jane Smith,Project Manager,85000
3,Bob Johnson,System Analyst,65000

 Loading
employees = LOAD 'path/to/employee.csv' USING
PigStorage(',') AS (eid: int, name: chararray, role:
chararray, salary: float);

 Describing
DESCRIBE employees;

 Filtering
sde_employees = FILTER employees BY role == 'Software
Developer';

 Grouping
grouped_employees = GROUP employees BY role;

 Joining
personal_info = LOAD 'path/to/personal_info.csv'
USING PigStorage(',') AS (eid: int, city: chararray, school:
chararray, score: int);
joined_data = JOIN employees BY eid, personal_info BY
eid;

 Counting
role_counts = FOREACH grouped_employees
GENERATE group AS role, COUNT(employees) AS
employee_count;

 Projecting
employee_details = FOREACH joined_data GENERATE
employees::name AS employee_name, employees::role AS
employee_role, personal_info::city AS city;

 Dumping
DUMP employee_details;
